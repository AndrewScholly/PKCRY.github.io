        <p>I have worked on a couple of projects with coding the main one being this website. So welcome to what I can do with html and css. I am continuing to learn how to code in html and css more efficiently and some javascript to make my website even more polished.</p>
        <p> I have worked on coding in Visual Basic Studio and a little bit of c# for coding video games in unity but I'm still getting there. I plan on continuing to code in unity and slowly learn how to make video games, but its a work in porgress.</p>

            <p>Git is a version control system to save work and share with others. I know how to clone, push, and work inside of git. Something that most coming out of college don't get the experience with. </p>
