    <h1>Hi I'm Nick Card</h1>
    <p>I have interests and accomplishments like the rest of you so maybe i'll share some of them here<p>
    <h2>What I Want to Accomplish</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> I want to be able to build websites as freelance work and to display what I can do as well as making a hub for my photography or video content</li>
        <li> Build software for small to mid range companies that is formatted to exactly what they need and not super overpriced</li>
        <li> Build my own video game as an indie developer to build what I want to build and kind of do it on the side</li>
        <li> Do what I can with software development. I want to be able to build what I want because I get enjoyment out of building something from scratch</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Video Games</h3>
      <p>I have a love for video games. Whether it's playing them or figuring out how they are built. I like to think about certain mechanics in a game and how someone thought of it and how someone implemented it.</p>
      <p>The game that I play the most is Super Smash Bros Ultimate. Most people play it casually but I play it competively.</p>
